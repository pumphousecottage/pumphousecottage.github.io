<h1>Why is Pump House Cottage called Pump House Cottage?</h1>
  <p>Pump House Cottage sits next to the "pump house" between the rivers of Old Water and New Water in Geltsdale, Cumbria.
    Unlike many pump houses in Cumbria, the "pump house" next to Pump House Cottage is not a pump house at all,
    but is a water measuring station, still owned and run by United Utilities.
    </p>
  <p>The name Pump House Cottage was given to it by Royal Mail, presumably believing that the name was accurate.
    The cottage was named by a previous owner as Geltsdale Cottage, but with multiple other Geltsdale Cottages in the area,
  the name had to change, so it became Pump House Cottage.</p>
  <p>Our Pump House Cottage may not be the only Pump House Cottage in Cumbria, but there's a good chance it is the most peaceful.
  Cumbria is the most sparsely populated county in England. And Geltsdale is very quiet.
    The water measuring station has no noisy machinery for pumping water since that is not its purpose, so there is nothing to disturb the birds or the people.</p>
